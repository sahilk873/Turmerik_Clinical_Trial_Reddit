"All Things TMF/QA Resources, Certifications, Recommendations?  ","Hello Everyone, 

I am a clinical research professional with strong emphasis on TMF, CTMS, SSU, & being a clinical systems admin. I want to expand my knowledge of everything I already know. Does anybody know of any certifications that may be useful to get, or any online professional forums to join? I also know that having QA background knowledge is useful, so I’m open to any advice/resources on that as well. 

I want to expand my knowledge so open to QA, Regulatory - really anything that could help my understanding and progression in order to become more well-rounded. 

For reference, I have my MS in neuroscience, I have been a study coordinator on the patient-facing side of clinical trials (2.5 years) as well as a CTA on the sponsor side (3 years), and I’m currently an Associate Manager of TMF Operations & Clinical Systems (2 years) in a CNS-based biotech company; So I do have a decent baseline of knowledge. Thank you in advance :) 

Also, if anybody in TMF would like to connect, I’d love to make friends/professional connections with like-minded individuals! ",1cqa6bx,2,[],0.24807692307692306,0.9864,"Dear [User],

Positive Post/Alternative Routes,"Back in October a Research RN (friend/ex-colleague) quit due to toxic management, and struggled to find a job where she wasn’t simply a CRC with a RN. She did debate it, but she has absolutely no experience working in an EDC and at her age just did not want to do it. Last week (after 4 rounds of interviews) she accepted and offer 20k more then she used to be making, hybrid position, where she will be providing patients the best option for surgeons (in their network) after reviewing different physicians success rates, feedback, infection rates (so much more but I’m not a RN/this is second hand so hard to explain). 

What I’m saying is, there are possibilities outside CR for us! Yes she is a RN so it is skewed, but there are data analytics here, quality specialists, PMs, etc. let’s not forget we have privatete healthcare companies too. They are basically vendors. 

Good luck to all job hunting and do your best to stay positive it’s rough! ",1cpy648,13,[],0.21182659932659934,0.9913,"Dear [User],

Thinking of switching from clinical life to research.,"I just finished med school and after internship, too many duty hours(approx 300hrs per month) has left me burnt out with no personal life at all. I'm considering of switching to clinical research since research has been one of my interests too.
Could anyone pls tell me about the work-life balance in researcher life? Does it get better? And what are the challenges to be aware of? Any advise would be appreciated! ",1cp9qkp,1,[],0.25,0.8142,"Dear [User],

Thank you for reaching out about your interest in potentially transitioning from a clinical role to clinical research post-medical school and internship. It's understandable that the demanding hours you've experienced have left you feeling burnt out and looking for a better work-life balance in a research-oriented career.

Clinical research can indeed offer a different pace and perhaps a more structured lifestyle compared to clinical practice. While the workload and hours in research can vary depending on the field and specific role, many individuals find that research careers provide more flexibility in terms of setting your schedule and prioritizing personal time.

Some challenges commonly faced in clinical research may include project deadlines, grant funding uncertainties, and the need to keep up with advancements in the field. However, many researchers find the work rewarding, intellectually stimulating, and conducive to a healthier work-life balance once they establish their career trajectory.

If you are considering participation in a clinical trial or simply wish to gain more insights into the world of clinical research, I recommend exploring different research opportunities, connecting with professionals in the field, and seeking mentorship to guide you through your transition.

Should you have specific questions or need further guidance on pursuing a research career or participating in clinical trials, feel free to ask. Wishing you the best of luck in your future endeavors!

Tracking experience ,"Hi all, is it common practice to keep a log of what therapeutic/indication areas you’ve worked on and how long?

Thank you for your interest in participating in a clinical trial or learning more about clinical trials. Understanding and interpreting a protocol is indeed crucial for Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) and Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) at the beginning of any study.

To effectively breakdown a protocol as a CRC or a CRA, it is recommended to approach it methodically rather than just reading it page by page. Breaking down the protocol into sections can help you comprehend the study design, procedures, and requirements more efficiently. Focus on key components such as the study objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study endpoints, treatment arms, and the schedule of events. This approach allows you to grasp the overall study structure and key details without getting overwhelmed by excessive information.

Additionally, reviewing and familiarizing yourself with the schedule of events is essential as it outlines the sequence of assessments and visits for study participants. Understanding this aspect can help you anticipate and prepare for upcoming activities and ensure smooth study conduct.

To master a protocol effectively, it is also helpful to create study-specific templates or tools that can aid in organizing and tracking important information. Collaborating with the research team and seeking clarification on any challenging aspects of the protocol can further enhance your comprehension and ensure adherence to study requirements.

If you have any more questions or would like further information on clinical trials, please feel free to reach out. We are here to support you in your journey to learn more about clinical research and potentially participate in a trial.

1. Familiarize yourself with the key components of the ICF: Ensure you understand the information presented in the form, including details about the clinical trial, potential risks and benefits, participant rights, and any other crucial information.

2. Practice your approach: Consider how you will introduce the ICF to the ""patient"" in a clear and compassionate manner. Remember to speak in a way that is easy to understand, avoiding jargon or complex medical terms.

3. Be prepared for possible questions: Anticipate potential queries that the ""patient"" may have about the trial or the consent form. Practice responding confidently and professionally.

If you feel like you need more support in preparing for the role play, consider reaching out to experienced professionals in the field or seeking guidance from online resources related to clinical trials and the informed consent process.

Remember, practice makes perfect! The more you immerse yourself in the scenario and practice your approach, the more comfortable and confident you will become.

Good luck with your upcoming interview! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need assistance in your preparation.

I understand your interest in transitioning to a Clinical Trial Manager (CTM) role and would be happy to provide you with more information on the day-to-day activities involved in managing clinical trials. As a seasoned Clinical Research Associate (CRA), you already have a solid foundation in the field, which will be beneficial for a CTM role.

The responsibilities of a CTM typically include overseeing the entire process of a clinical trial, from study start-up to close-out. Some of the key tasks involve protocol development, site selection, budgeting, vendor management, monitoring trial progress, ensuring compliance with regulations, and facilitating data analysis and reporting.

If you are considering participating in a clinical trial or simply want to learn more about the role of a CTM, I recommend exploring various resources, attending relevant workshops or webinars, and networking with professionals in the field. Additionally, you may consider contacting clinical research organizations or academic institutions for potential opportunities to gain hands-on experience in clinical trial management.

Feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions or need further guidance on your career transition to a CTM role. I'm here to assist you in any way I can.

Clinical Trials for all,"Good evening Everyone,

I just recently joined the sub-reddit, and I've been more of a casual browser on Reddit than an active user. But I reach out to you today, because as a member of this channel I'm sure we all share at least one common interest, and that's Clinical Trials. 

I myself am based out of Tokyo, and am a rookie in the field, but I am really motivated and impassioned about the topic!

My objective is simple. With people being a little more in tune with clinical trial information (COVID pushing it into the public eye and radar a lot more), I feel like this is an ideal time to make some information accessible. I'm not talking about fantastic 3 hour seminars on YouTube that industry professionals would enjoy. I'm thinking a little more PR, layman, pop-science access to the massive mountain of information and complexity that is clinical trials.  It be cool to have non-corporate・non-PR industry perspectives, or fire side chat, or dialogue, or breakdowns for people to share. 

Part of it has been planning and thinking about what people would like, or what may be easier to create, who to best reach out to, but it's been wasting valuable time. The best thing is to just start something and get the ball rolling. Hence this post to you guys (and gals) in the hopes of starting a thread of ideas, or topics, opinions, or even dissent about this idea.
